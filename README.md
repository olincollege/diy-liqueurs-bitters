# DIY Liqueurs and Bitters

This repository contains materials for the DIY Liqueurs and Bitters
Co-Curricular.

## History

This co-curricular started in Fall 2021 with a focus on fruit liqueurs. In Fall
2022, it expanded to cover bitters as well.

I (Steve Matsumoto) have been making liqueur and bitters since 2019, and it
became somewhat of a pandemic hobby. During the 2020-2021 academic year, I made
several gallons of liqueur (most of which I gave away as gifts).

The co-curricular is mostly inspired by
[*rakija*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakia)-style liqueurs, which are
associated with former Yugoslavia and the Balkans (i.e., Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia). Most
*rakija* is home distilled, but distilling your own liquor is federally illegal
in the US, so we instead make *rectified spirits*, which involves infusing
ingredients in a neutral spirit like vodka or grain alcohol.

## What is Liqueur? What are Bitters?

Liqueur is typically a spirit with additional flavoring, like sugar, fruits,
herbs, or spices. In the US, the term *liqueur* specifically refers to alcohol
mixed with plant products or sweeteners (at least 2.5% by weight).

Example liqueurs that you may be familiar with include Chambord, Kahlua,
Bailey's Irish Cream, St. Germain, Cointreau/Triple Sec, Midori, Chartreuse, or
JÃ¤germeister.

Bitters are an infusion of ingredients in alcohol designed to be a strong
concetration of flavor. As the name suggests, bitters are intended to be bitter
rather than sweet. The term *tincture* is more general, referring to an infusion
of any flavor rather than specifically bitter ones. Bitters that you might be
familiar with are Angostura bitters, Peychaud's bitters (used in Sazeracs), and
orange bitters.

## Why Should You Make Your Own Bitters and Liqueur?

* It's pretty easy - all you need is flavoring, alcohol, and time for the basic
  recipes.
* You can preserve the flavors of fruits at their peak freshness and have
  something to enjoy for months or years afterwards.
* It was traditionally a way to reuse resources - the base spirits used for
  traditional *rakija* were often distilled from spent grapes resulting from
  winemaking.

## How is Liqueur or Bitters Made?

Generally, the liqueur or bitters we'll make in this co-curricular follow these
rough steps:

* Prepare the non-alcoholic ingredients. This may involve peeling fruit,
  cracking spices, etc.
* Infuse the ingredients in alcohol for some time. Sometimes, the infusion is
  left in the sun or shaken regularly.
* Strain the infusion. Sometimes, additional ingredients, most commonly simple
  syrup (made from sugar and water), are added here.
* Bottle the resulting product.

## Recipes

The `recipes` folder contains a collection of recipes from past versions of the
co-curricular. Not all of them were made, and students have made their own
recipes which don't appear in the folder, but you are welcome to use or adapt
any of the recipes you see there.

If you are interested in making a different liqueur or bitters, contact me and I
can help you put together a recipe.

## Supplies

You need to get your own supplies. If you are officially in the co-curricular,
the college will cover the cost of all non-alcoholic ingredients up to a
specified per-person amount.

Almost every recipe uses one of the following as a base spirit:

* Vodka: this is typically 40% alcohol by volume, and is used for many lighter
  liqueurs. This often results in a final product that is 10-20% alcohol by
  volume.
* 150-proof grain alcohol: this is 75% alcohol by volume (sometimes you may see
  151-proof, which is 75.5%, but it's essentially the same). Everclear is a
  well-known brand, but anything with "grain alcohol" usually refers to this
  product. This spirit results in a final product that is 20-40% alcohol by
  volume. This can be diluted down to a slightly weaker concentration as well,
  most commonly 60%.
* 190-proof grain alcohol: this is 95% alcohol by volume, which is the strongest
  concentration of ethanol that's commercially available. Everclear also makes a
  190-proof grain alcohol, as do a few other manufacturers, but this product is
  not available in some US states. It's not recommended to dilute this down, as
  it tends to retain a strong alcoholic taste even when diluted. This spirit
  can result in final products that are as strong as 60% alcohol by volume.

In the Needham area, your best bet for vodka is typically Costco, where Kirkland
Signature vodka can be had for well under $20 a handle (1.75 liters). For grain
alcohol, Total Wine in Natick tends to carry a variety of brands for both 150
and 190-proof products.
