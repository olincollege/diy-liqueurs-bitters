# Raspberry Liqueur

## Ingredients

* 2.2 lbs (1 kg) raspberries
* 1 l Everclear (95%)

1. Carefully wash and dry the raspberries, muddle them gently and place them into a large bottle.
2. Pour the alcohol over them and mix everything well. The resulting mixture should remain for 4 weeks in the sun.
